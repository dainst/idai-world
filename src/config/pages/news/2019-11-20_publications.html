<b>The redesign of the Archäologischer Anzeiger</b>
<br>
Through the redesign of the Archäologischer Anzeiger the DAI is entering conceptually and technically uncharted territory. The most important new feature is that the contributions will be accessible over a responsive viewer format as open access through the portal iDAI.publications. For the design of the responsive web viewer considerable emphasis was placed on arranging the text, notes, and figures in parallel columns so that all contributions are clearly structured and easy to follow. Images and notes can be retrieved adjacent to the text without the need to ›jump‹ within the contribution. Through the flexible arrangement of the contents, articles can also be conveniently and easily read on a tablet or even a smartphone. The subscription book edition in high quality print will remain and at the same time additional PDFs will also be made available free of charge in the future. For the reader it is completely negligible with which medium they are working. All three output formats – viewer article, book, or PDF – are furnished with all relevant information for the scientific citation, including persistent identifiers such as URNs and DOIs. The contributions will also feature a paragraph numbering so that even the viewer format can be correctly cited.

<b>New features of the DAI-Journal-Viewer</b>
<br>
For the first time within the field of Archaeology, the DAI-Journal-Viewer provides for the possibility of connecting and expanding articles with digital supplements or research data in an easily accessible format. These digital catalogs, which are an integral part of the articles and also are part of the peer-review process, can be accessed through the heading »Supplements«. They will be published in a structured form in the contextually appropriate and designated systems of the iDAI.world – first and foremost in iDAI.objects/arachne – and then presented in the space precisely provided in the viewer. Furthermore, the contributions can be enhanced with links to explanatory and supporting information, such as comparanda, geodata, or similar items, which will be displayed in the header »Extra Features«. In this way the findability and accessibility of the contributions will be increased. An additional aspect will be new and has been requested by many authors, namely the addition of established persistent identifiers, such as ORCID- or GND IDs in order to make the contributions uniquely and personally identifiable and to visualize – in combination with other identifiers like DOIs – the scientific dissemination of articles.

<b>Archäologischer Anzeiger – for 130 years</b>
<br>
The Archäologischer Anzeiger was first introduced in 1889 as a supplement to the Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts. In 1976 it was established as a separate journal and has appeared since 2002 with two issues per year. From the beginning, it was a place for essays, reports, and small papers for a broad, international scientific community and it will remain such. The geographical and chronological focus is on the archaeology of the Mediterranean and Near East from Prehistory to Late Antiquity. In accordance with the journal’s scope and the research practice of the department, contributions to the Archäologischer Anzeiger are also welcome that discuss the large-scale connections and networks of the ancient world to the northern European, Eurasian and African regions. The quality of the Archäologischer Anzeiger is guaranteed by a double blind peer-review process as well as thorough text and image editing. Naturally, this will continue to be the case in the digital world.
<br>
The journal can now be consulted by a much larger audience worldwide than before and supports
a faster and more effective international scholarly exchange and collaboration. An internet connection is all it takes to be able to read a contribution in the Archäologischer Anzeiger on the day of its publication, everywhere on the globe, and independently of the individual possibilities to visit a well-equipped specialist library.
