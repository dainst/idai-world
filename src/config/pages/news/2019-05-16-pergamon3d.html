<p>The Pergamon excavation is thus one of the oldest and largest German archaeological research projects abroad. The project has long since developed into an international research platform. Colleagues from Turkey, Germany and many other countries work together to research and preserve the <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1457">UNESCO World</a><a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1457">Heritage Site Pergamon</a>. Thanks to the intensive archaeological work and scientific documentation of the preserved buildings, the researchers could now reconstruct and visualise individual buildings, architectural ensembles, and even large parts of the city.</p>
<br><b>The exhibition “Pergamon resurrected!”</b></br>
    <p>In 2018 the exhibition “Pergamon resurrected!” in the <a href="http://antik.gko.uni-leipzig.de/index.php?id=14">Antikenmuseum der Universität Leipzig</a> presented for the first time the numerous reconstructions. Since the beginning of the excavations reconstructions of the ruins have been created in various media. Based on the archaeological evidence documented by the German Archaeological Institute and survey data collected by the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, a virtual 3D reconstruction of the ancient Pergamon the was created by the Chair of Design, Building Theory and Interior Design at the <a href="https://www.b-tu.de/en/entwerfen-gebaeudekunde-und-raumgestaltung">BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg</a> in Brandenburg.</p>

<p>The visualization demonstrates a possible version of the city around 200 AD.  The research results are presented in a short film. The viewer can follow the food steps of the ancient inhabitants of the city or explore the Pergamon cityscape from a bird’s-eye view. The gymnasium, the lower Agora, the theatre or the Hera Temple are just a few examples that can be seen in the film. The video 3D visualisation is freely accessible in German.</p>
