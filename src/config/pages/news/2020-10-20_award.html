After nomination for the shortlist, the DAI’s new publishing format has won the 2020 Digital Publishing Award in the category Process/Technology. The award was announced at a digital conference during the Frankfurt Book Fair on 15 October 2020. Thanks to the “thorough modernization” of something very traditional, a modern and ground-breaking journal format has been created via which “a public good is made accessible to all”, the Digital Publishing Award jury commented in its commendation of the new conception.
<br>
<br>
Freely accessible journal articles can now be conveniently opened in a responsive viewer, which offers direct links to research data from various information resources of the DAI. In this way individual artefacts can be viewed for comparison, for instance, and digital supplements like extensive find catalogues, 3D models and geodata can be incorporated into the journal articles being viewed. This networked publishing solution was central to the submission for the award.
<br>
<br>
The jury noted that it was not a stand-alone project, as availability could be extended to other publications. And indeed right in time for the award ceremony, the first issues of two further DAI journals – the Journal of Global Archaeology and the Research E-Papers – were released in this new format.
<br>
<br>
The award recognizes innovative projects in the field of digital publishing, which contribute towards progress in the digital transformation of the publishing industry.

Archäologischer Anzeiger continues to appear as a <a href="https://reichert-verlag.de/buchreihen/altertumswissenschaften_reihen/altertumswissenschaften_archaeologischer_anzeiger/9783954904716_archaeologischer_anzeiger-detail">high-quality print edition</a>.
<br>
<br>
Development and realization of the concept, in which specially further developed open source software was used for as many components as possible, is a joint project of the Central Scientific Services of the DAI – in particular the editorial office and the IT section. LMK – Büro für Kommunikationsdesign Tanja Lemke-Mahdavi was commissioned to support the digital publishing project in cooperation with the businesses LEAN BAKERY and dpc-consulting.
