<p>The MoU is intended to strengthen technological and infrastructural cooperation of both institutions, with the aim of creating modern, digital systems for heritage management and protection of monuments in Afghanistan. Within this framework of cooperation, the DAI provides virtual server resources, running open source software, and trains MUDL staff in its use and administration. The MUDL creates its own datasets and stores them on the new system, effectively building a spatial data infrastructure for heritage management. In a step-by-step process, all parts of the infrastructure will be transfered or newly implemented in Afghanistan. Other relevant Afghan ministries and institutions are planned to share the new platform, providing a modern, digital foundation for heritage management and protection of monuments in the country.

This project is considered a pilot implementation with potential applicability to other regions of the world that have similar needs and conditions.
