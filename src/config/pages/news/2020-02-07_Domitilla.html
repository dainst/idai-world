<p>From 20th – 25th March 2020 these last investigations could be conducted through an invitation of the „Papal Commission for Holy Archaeology“ in cooperation between the DAI Rome Department and the TU Vienna. The DAI Rome (N. Zimmermann, previously ÖAW Vienna) has been working with construction researchers from the Institute for Construction History and Research of the TU Vienna (I. Mayer, E. Kodzman) in the documentation of the Domitialla catacomb. The research questions at the moment – aside from wall painting and inscriptions – mostly contain aspects of funerary statistics and archaeology of economy as well as special topographical-chronological developments of the catacomb. The integration of the aboveground terrain model into the general plan of the catacomb helps understand how the catacomb was accessible from the Via Ardeatina through stairways and how long these stayed in use.

The works were also possible due to external help: the 3D laser scanner (model VZ 400i) was provided by RIEGL Laser Measurement Systems (Horn, Austria) as it has been before. Preliminary results after the first day of scanning already shows a dense point cloud in the surveyed area of the surface with the network of measuring positions.
