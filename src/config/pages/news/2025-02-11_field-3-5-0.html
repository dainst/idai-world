The new version now allows the creation of project-specific relations by adding a new field in the configuration editor and selecting the input type "Relation". Detailed information on this can be found in the manual (chapter "Project configuration", subchapter "Fields"). Other new features include a zoom function in the image viewer and the option to export the currently displayed matrix in formats Dot (GraphViz) and SVG. The manual now also includes a detailed new chapter on import and export, with explanations and examples for supported file formats. The additional installation of the Java JDK is no longer required for Shapefile import and export.
    Portuguese is now available as a new user interface language. Many thanks to Luna Watkins for the Portuguese translation, and to Camilla Colombi (Italian), Andrij Kutnyi (Ukrainian) and Onur Ã–zbalaban (Turkish) for updating and expanding the respective translations for the new version!
