<p>To get to the project overview and issue evaluation, members may login into their FieldHub instance with the same
    credentials they normally use to synchronize their Field Desktop with the server.</p>

<p>There are 3 tiers of possible issues:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Yellow: "Nice to have". These issues are very basic suggestions on how you could improve your project data for
        later publication. You may choose to ignore these issues if they do not fit your needs. Example: No default map
        background(s) are set for the project. These would serve as defaults when displaying the map without any further
        user input.
    </li>
    <li>Orange: Integrity issues that are expected to occur for a running project. We strongly recommend to fix these as
        described in the issue and as soon as possible to ensure integrity. Example: Missing image attributions.</li>
    <li>Red: Integrity issues that may indicate an error in the application. Especially very old project databases may
        contain documents or document states, that can be traced back to old errors in the Desktop application, which by
        now have been fixed. Another source for these kind of issues are faulty CSV imports. We strongly recommend to
        fix these. If you are unsure what to do about these errors, do not hesitate to contact us.</li>
</ul>
