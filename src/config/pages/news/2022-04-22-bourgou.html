    The ancient name of the settlement is still unknown, although there are various references to the oppidum Phoar/Thoar mentioned by Pliny. Despite significant finds from surface surveys and the stately remains of a Hellenistic Mausoleum, which indicate a significant role for Henchir Bourgou in pre-Roman times, the ancient site was not initially listed as an official historical site. This was finally achieved in 2017, when a considerable part of the ancient area was threatened by the construction of a shopping mall. In response to an urgent request for assistance from the <a href="https://inp.rnrt.tn/" target="_blank">Institut National du Patrimoine</a> (INP/Tunisia), the Scientific Department of the <a href="https://www.dainst.org/">DAI</a> Head Office and the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/" target="_blank">Ludwig-Maximilians-University</a> of Munich carried out a magnetometer survey, covering around half of the ancient settlement area, revealing an enormous density of ancient buildings. Excavation carried out by the Tunisian archaeologists in the summer of 2018, and the processing of the finds by an international team the following year, showed a stratigraphy whose layers can be dated from the 8th century BCE to the 2nd century CE.

    As part of these research activities, iDAI.field2 was employed. In order to be compatible with earlier datasets and to ensure later data comparability, an existing data collection table (xlsx-File) based on a system by French colleagues established in Tunisia for ceramic processing was compared with the data structure in iDAI.field2 and could be mapped to the fields (detailed report see: <a href="https://doi.org/10.34780/1m14-8g1p">Vom Feld in die Datenbank und zurück. iDAI.ﬁeld als digitale Datenbank für die Verwaltung von alten und neuen Daten – ein Arbeitsbericht</a>). The (especially linguistic) adaptation on the basis of the same fields and the same/similar value lists enables homogeneous data collection and allows long-term comparison of data from different projects.
