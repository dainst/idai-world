<p> The Pelegios Networks has been a long time partner of the DAI linking information online through common references to places while focusing on six core activities: <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/annotation/">annotation</a>, <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/collaboration/">collaboration</a>, <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/gazetteers/">gazetteers</a>, <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/pedagogy/">pedagogy</a>, <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/registry/">registry</a>, <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/visualisation/">visualization</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>As of 2019, Pelagios has moved on from being simply a project to being an own network, the Pelagios Networks, which is funded by <a href="https://mellon.org"/>the Mellon Foundation</a>. Although the network does not have any funding powers, it does present itself with a constitution. 
The network is formed by around 20 members so far that are bound to the network by a memorandum of understanding. The former working groups are now represented in the six activities fulfilled by Pelagios: annotation, collaboration, gazetteer, pedagogy, registry and visualization.</p>
<br>
<p>The DAI is one of the original founding partners of the Pelagios Network and also provides one of the two activity coordinators of the gazetteer activities, Wolfang Schmidle.</p>
