<u>The Archive of Friedrich W. Hinkel</u>
<br>
Friedrich W. Hinkel (1925-2007) conducted research in Sudan for more than 40 years and compiled more than 70,000 photos, maps and documents about thousands of archaeological sites in Sudan. His most noteworthy contributions aside from the rescue of the Nubian temples of Semna, Kumma, Buhen and Aksha from flooding as a part of the Assuan damn project, is the large scale restoration of the pyramids of Meroe. His archive is the largest privately compiled research archive worldwide with a focus on cultural sites of ancient and historical Sudan. The digitizing of the archive was made possible thanks to generous funding from the Qatar Sudan Archaeological Project and the Foreign Ministry of Germany. 34,000 photographs, 12,000 slide positives, more than 500 topographical maps, 4000 drawings, 20,000 index cards and 288 scientific media collections were made accessible digitally by a cooperation of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums of Sudan and the CoDArchLab of the University of Cologne.

<u>Sudan Digital: A digital monument register for Sudan</u>
<br>
The aim of the project “Sudan Digital” that was started in March 2017 and was funded by the Foreign Ministry of Germany is support in the creation of a national monument register of Sudan. Despite many excavations and research projects that have been conducted in Sudan since the 19th century, the African country does not have a register so far that systematically records the numerous historical monuments and archaeological sites.
<br>
Specifically designed training schools and intensive scientific and technical support on site are supposed to help the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums develop a database that caters to their specific needs. A transfer of datasets to 14,000 sites from the Friedrich-Hinkel-Research-Archive and technical conditions for the creation of a digital monument register could be implemented on an on site on a server in 2018.

<u>Further projects of the DAI in Sudan</u>
<br>
Since 1999 the so-called royal baths of the ancient capital of Meroe are being investigated as a part of a Sudanese-German cooperation. The complex is an outstanding proof for the influence of the Hellenistic-Roman sphere on the African kingdom of Kusch. Currently, a new protective structure is being built that allows the preservation of this exceptional building and access of visitors.

A comprehensive map of a Meroitic city was reconstructed in a cooperation of the NCAM, the DAI and the University of Shendi based on excavations in Hamadab near Meroe. Research in Hamadab could produce fundamental insights into the urban organization and daily life constructs of a Sub-Saharan city.

The largest current cooperation project between Sudan and Germany is the Qatari Mission for the Pyramids of Sudan (QMPS): Since 2014, NCAM and the DAI have been conducting large scale archaeological and architectonical documentations as well as restorations for the research and preservation of the royal pyramids of Meroe. This meaningful ancient site in Sudan is part of the UNESCO world heritage and is being developed for sustainable tourism.
