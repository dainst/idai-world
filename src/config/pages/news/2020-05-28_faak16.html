Due to large-scale excavations, Jauranga (285 m.a.s.l.), Collanco (1.630 m.a.s.l), and Cutamalla (3.300 m.a.s.l.) are the most important archaeological sites for this study. The information presented in the database served as the primary basis for the research and results which are treated at greater length in the monograph. Moreover, the long-term storage of this data makes the material available for future investigations. Objects attributed to the Paracas culture (800 to 200 BC) in southern Peru are displayed in museums all over the world, attracting visitors and encouraging people to travel to Peru. “Typical” Paracas objects are incised polychrome ceramics of high quality, large and extremely carefully made textiles with elaborate geometric designs, extravagant mummy bundles with rich grave goods which have been preserved in the sandy hyper-arid desert of the Pacific coast, and artificially deformed human skulls. The emphasis on this kind of material culture was the foundation for defining the archaeological culture, stimulating ideas about the nature of the Paracas society.

The approach chosen in this work complements previous research designs and provides a new perspective on the Paracas culture. The archaeological material analyzed here was unearthed in large quantities and represents the sphere of everyday life of the Paracas people. An archaeoeconomic methodology was applied to look at this material, an approach not previously employed, which explored production, exchange, and consumption processes and their interconnections through the archaeological record.
