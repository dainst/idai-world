<p> The North Africa Research Archive unites various bequests and project documentations from North Africa that are housed at the DAI.
Both portals allow researchers and also the public to inform themselves about North Africa and to supplement already existing publications. This is especially helpful for researchers that focus on North Africa that now have worldwide access to the material in Rome.

The bequest of Friedrich Rakob is comprised of more than 63,000 photographic negatives, slide positives and contact prints, as well as excavation note books, drawings, plans, presentations and other documents. The largest part of the material is the documentation of cooperations with the Cultural Heritage Ministry of Tunisia - today’s Institut National du Patrimoine (INP) – in the excavations of Chimtou and Carthage, where he was working from the 60s to the 90s. The DAI is again working on excavations and restoration projects at both sites.

The Rakob bequest is further a part of the NARA portal, which offers a platform for archaeological material in the North African region with a focus on the Maghreb. It is continuously growing, as pre- and post-mortem bequests of researchers working in North Africa owned by the DAI are added successively. Among these are the Rome Department’s holdings of the Byzantine art historian and archaeologist Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann (1909-1993), of Christa von Hees-Landwehr (†2012) on Roman sculpture in the Museum of Cherchell in Algeria and of Josef Röder (1914-1974) on stone quarries and marble extraction in the Tunisian city of Chimtou. These holdings are supposed to be added into the North African Heritage Archives Network (NAHAN), which has the aim to collect information on monuments and cultural goods in North Africa. At the moment, the bequest of architectural and Islam studies researcher Christian Ewert is being process at the Madrid Department.</p>
