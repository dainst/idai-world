<p>With the processing and publishing of the Ayamonte project data, an important methodical and pioneering process for digital data collection and publication in unison with international cooperation projects could be accomplished. This resulted in the most important basics for the analysis of data within an interactive online database in German and Spanish (<a href="http://field.idai.world/project/ayamonte">http://field.idai.world/project/ayamonte</a>). The data publication can be considered the digital appendix to the monography on the project (see below).

The platform iDAI.tutorial offers online courses and resources for experts from the areas of cultural heritage and archaeology. All resources are free of cost and available in English and Arabic. The aim of the courses is to support experts from the fields of cultural heritage, archaeology and museum management. Additionally, the platform provides the first Arabic translation of International Standards and Guideline to Digitalization (f.e. OAIS, Dubin Core, etc.)

<b>The project “The Phoenician necropolis of Ayamonte (Huelva, Andalusia, Spain)</b>
<br><br>
The DAI Madrid department of the DAI conducted a research excavation in 2013 that was authorized by the Andalusian office of heritage sites (Delegación General del Patrimoio Arqueológico y de Instituciones Museisticas de la Junta de Andalucía, Sevilla / Delegación de Cultura de Huelva) in cooperation with Elisabeth García Teyssandier. The project was part of the DAI-cluster 6 “Connecting Cultures” (Since 2021 “Connecting Cultures?”). The funding came from the scientific budget of the DAI. Aside from the archaeological excavations, other disciplines have been involved too (anthropology, archaeobotany, archaeometry, geography, information technology). The finds are now located in the Museo de Huelva.

<b>Publication of the research results</b>
<br><br>
The publication of the Phoenician tombs of Ayamonte is characterized by a comprehensive documentation. Nineteen authors have been contributing, e.g. on the Phoenician settlement, their progressive workshops, the suitable port and the hinterland with its settlement and economic history. Like a mirror, the results of this basic research project show the oriental origin of the Phoenicians and their lives in their new home. The tombs show age, illness and adherence to original traditions. They allow an insight into a widely connected and influential society.
