<p>It is to be understood as a work in progress, as new objects are regularly uploaded to <a href='https://arachne.dainst.org/project/palatinGIS?lang=en'>iDAI.objects</a> 
and linked to layers in <a href='https://geoserver.dainst.org/#/'>iDAI.geoserver</a>. The project page makes it possible to follow the growth of the data 'live' 
and access it with just a few clicks.</p>

<p>The Palatine geoinformation system is being developed as part of a research project at the Institute of Archaeological Sciences at Ruhr University Bochum. 
Under the title "<a href="https://www.archwiss.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/aw/forschung/palatin.html.en">From hand drawing to digital model. The Palatine in Rome as a 
case study for knowledge generation in archaeology</a>", the visualization history of the Palatine is being examined in detail. Within the resulting geoinformation 
system images of the Palatine collected in iDAI.objects are linked with corresponding plans of the Palatine in the iDAI.geoserver. The catalogue texts written for
each entry also contain detailed information on each object. This makes it possible to quickly search for and compare pictures of the Palatine according to specific
criteria (subject, date, artist, etc.). In addition to an analytical monograph on the subject of the research project, the data generated is freely available for 
further research.</p>
