<p>Dr. Iris Gerlach and her team, being in constant contact with their Yemenite colleagues at the General Organisation of Antiquities and Museums (GOAM), initiated a new project to protect Yemen’s cultural heritage: AYDA, the Ancient Yemen Digital Atlas. “The idea behind the project is to register digitally all the known monuments in an internet-based heritage information system. This system is set up and maintained in collaboration with our Yemenite colleagues. It is also available for scientific research questions, but it primarily serves the Yemenite antiquities authority for the management and protection of the national cultural heritage. Unfortunately, Yemen did not have so far a list of systematically registered sites, not even in the simple form of a register of monuments. For this reason the digital atlas will also fulfil this function. The atlas is simply and intelligibly structured and easy to use. This is not a mere analysis of aerial photographs or satellite images; rather all the locations of registered monuments were verified either through positive verification on-site or through reliable specialist publications.”, says Dr. Iris Gerlach.</p>

<p>The idea was to create an information system using a map, i.e. a geographic information system (GIS). An existing archaeological map was used as a basis. It was digitised, georeferenced and the represented sites, once checked, were registered. The possibilities are very wide-ranging and scientifically relevant through their linkage with extended data. AYDA makes the monitoring of World Heritage sites possible. This allows the Yemenite authorities to conduct fast damage assessment and to take immediate protection measures. “If the antiquities authority or the responsible authorities cannot intervene immediately, at least the documentation has been made and if necessary the world’s public informed. Based on scientific research and the monitoring we can finally develop joint strategies as to how to deal with a site in the future.”</p>
<p>AYDA will be accessible for selected researchers and cultural institutions. An Arabic user interface was developed; therefore, the system can be accessed and updated by entering new data and sites by Yemenite colleagues at the antiquities authority. This guarantees accurate monitoring, which is the basis for preservation and possible later development for the public.
    AYDA is made possible because of a large cooperation network. In addition to our cooperation partners in the field of archaeology, the project cooperates closely with researchers from Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, HCU Hamburg, University of Tübingen and the Freie Universität Berlin.  A team from the <a href="https://www.dainst.org">German Archaeological Institute</a> (Sana’a Office) currently based in Berlin conducts the project. AYDA is part of the Archaeological Heritage Network and was financed by the <a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/aussenpolitik/themen/kulturdialog/09-kulturerhalt">Cultural Preservation Programme of the German Federal Foreign Office</a>.</p>
