For a better understanding of the city and its buildings in relation to the terrain, the buildings of the post-antique period have been blanked, but can be overlaid if necessary. The same applies to the Kestel dam and its water reservoir. The original relief in the area of the modern reservoir has been reconstructed on the basis of older maps.

Two sections of the map with different scales are published as PDF. These maps can be found on the blog of the Pergamon project linked below.
The 1:5.000 map (A0) extends from the Niyazi Tepe in the northeast with the temple-tomb to the extra-urban thermal bath of Cleopatra Güzellik Ilıcası in the southwest. This covers a much larger area than on the 1973 map at 1:2.500, but does not quite match the 1:25.000 overview map by Otto Berlet from 1904.

The digital versions of the new archaeological map are dynamic and will be continuously updated accordingly.
