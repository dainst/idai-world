It was created with the adaptation of the open source software ATOM of the service iDAI.archives. The photo libraries of the DAI are continuously digitized, as are the archives and the archives. However, especially valuable books and the publications published since its founding in 1829 by the DAI are being digitized to protect the existing status and to improve accessibility.</p>"

Soon after, projects for systematic digitization began, following digitization projects in the Archives. Examples include the DFG-funded projects EMAGINES and the digitization of drawings, plans and constructions of the 19th and 20th century in the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. Further projects within the program for the preservation of cultural heritage and the project \"Zero Hour - a future for the post-crisis\" were supported by the Federal Foreign Office. Today, the archives are systematically digitized at all departments of the DAI.</p>"
