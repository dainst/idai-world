However, especially valuable books and publications published by the DAI since its founding in 1829 are being digitized to protect the existing status and to improve accessibility.</p>"

Examples include the DFG-funded projects EMAGINES and the digitization of drawings, plans and constructions of the 19th and 20th century in the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. Further projects within the program for the preservation of cultural heritage and the project \"Zero Hour - a future for after the crisis\" were supported by the Federal Foreign Office.
