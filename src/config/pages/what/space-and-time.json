To improve and facilitate the research process, the DAI is putting a new focus on all place related data in the institute. Historic and modern names of a place, in different ancient and modern languages, are searchable in iDAI.Gazeteer. Localization in places, though, needs support by localization in time, through iDAI.Chronontology. Modern technology helps gather and represent geospatial data and widen the understanding for archaeological interrelationships. One implementation: the iDAI.Geoserver and connected geographic information systems (GIS)."
