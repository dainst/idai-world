To improve and facilitate the research process, the DAI is placing a new focus on all place related data in the institute. Historic and modern names of places, in different ancient and modern languages, are searchable in iDAI.gazetteer. Localization in places, though, needs support by placement in time, through iDAI.chronontology. Modern technology helps gather and represent geospatial data and widen the understanding for archaeological interrelations. One implementation is the iDAI.geoserver with connected geographic information systems (GIS)."
