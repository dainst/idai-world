Magazines and monographs of the DAI are published digitally. The digital offers are constantly being expanded and are thus accessible worldwide. Since the 19th century, the DAI has built significant thesauri and makes them accessible under iDAI thesauri. The thesauri are strong tools in themselves, but also a useful source for Text Mining and Linked Open Data approaches."
