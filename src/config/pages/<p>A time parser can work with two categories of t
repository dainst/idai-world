<p>A time parser can work with two categories of temporal terms: first being regular time expressions that can be identified and normalized by any competent speaker of the language and the second being temponyms, meaning spans of time that can be identified only with outside information.
<br>
<br>
The project „mulitlingualism of time“ used material from archaeological journals from different geographical regions and publication dates in order to cover a wide range of expressions in the five example languages: English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. 50 contiguous sentences were chosen in each text and annotated manually. 
<br>
<br>
The time parser used for the project was Heideltime, already being very adequate in its annotations. Temponyms proved to be harder for the time parser than regular time expressions.
<br>
<br>
Generally, the project opened a discussion about including time parsers into search engines and further using machine learning to work more on these questions under investigation.
